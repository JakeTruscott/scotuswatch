These only include cases that were orally argued and decided -- They do \textbf{not} consider cases that were consolidated for arguments (Ex: \emph{Danco Laboratories v. Alliance for Hipp. Medicine} with \emph{FDA v. Alliance for Hipp. Medicine}) or in rendering a decision (Ex: \emph{Relentless, Inc. v. DOC} with \emph{Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo}). For percentages including those cases as well, see next page.} \\
